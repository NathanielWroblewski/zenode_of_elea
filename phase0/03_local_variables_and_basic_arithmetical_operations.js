// Create two integer variables called num1 and num2 and assign them your favorite numbers.

// Next, compute the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus of these two numbers and assign these values to variables called sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus, respectively.

// For the quotient, be sure to convert the variables to Floats before dividing.
